# Pw-Generator

## Description

Objective was to build a password generator for the user that provided different options for password criteria. Building this project helped familiarize me with javascript. For the user, a password length was determined as well as the criteria they chose for their generated password. For this to be possible, I learned how to set up arrays, create yes/no questions for the user in which certain arrays would be included or not included in the generated password, create alerts for when criteria was not met, and most importantly generate an appropriate password that met the acceptance criteria. 

## Installation

1. Clone from repo.
2. Open folder with visual studio code or any text editor of choice.
3. Run index.html to run code.


## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.

## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
