# Pw-Generator

## Description

Objective was to build a password generator for the user that provided different options for password criteria. Building this project helped familiarize me with javascript. For the user, a password length was determined as well as the criteria they chose for their generated password. For this to be possible, I learned how to set up arrays, create yes/no questions for the user in which certain arrays would be included or not included in the generated password, create alerts for when criteria was not met, and most importantly generate an appropriate password that met the acceptance criteria. 

## Installation
